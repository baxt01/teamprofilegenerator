This App will take inputs into the CLI, for basic employee info and create a team profile web page based on the given info.
To do this I have used inquirer, fs, path, from the node package libraries.
first I have created a recursive function within the .prompts,
I have used a range of prompt types from a basic input, email, number and list,
Doing this has allowed a basic level validation of the data been inputted into the prompts.
I have also used a when clause in the office number, github user name, and school prompts,
the reason for this is because not every team member needs all this information and the 
nature of the when clause means those prompts will only be called if the condition is met I.E 
if you select the role of manager the next prompt is asking for office number.
then at the end of the prompts you get a boolean prompt of yes or no to do you want to add another employee.
To allow the accurate construction of the html document at the end I have built this APP based on 4 class files,
1 parent class 'Employee.js' and 3 sub-classes 'Manager.jd', Engineer.js', and 'Intern.js'.
